  <h4>Welcome to Yearbook!</h4>
  <br>
  <p>Yearbook is an alternative social networking website built exclusively for college students. The website will share resemblance with Facebook, the worldâ€™s most popular
  social networking site. The goal of this website is taking the great parts of Facebook (timeline, profile,
  friend system), removing the bad parts of Facebook, and combining several other ideas from social
  networking giants and combine them into one exclusive social networking hub.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Built by <a href="http://pickuperic.com" target="_blank">Eric Pickup</a> for our COMP-2707 final project.</p>
